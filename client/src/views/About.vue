    <h3>PetHub</h3>
    <p class="text-center">Pethub is a project to place more pets with families. According to the ASPCA each year
      approximately <strong>1.5
        million
        shelter animals are euthanized</strong>. That equates to about <strong>670,000 dogs</strong> and
      <strong>860,000 cats</strong>. If we could place
      more
      unwated animals in homes, we could assist in minimizing the number of euthanized animals.</p>

    <p>In addition to placing unwanted animals in families, we support and reccommend getting pets spayed or neutered.
